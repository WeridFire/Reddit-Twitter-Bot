# Reddit Image Twitter Bot

This Twitter bot fetches images from specified subreddits and posts them to Twitter. Additionally, it can respond to comments using the ChatGPT unofficial API.
NOTE: this bot is only a showoff, it is not ment to be used. It uses the unofficial Chatgpt api and uses web scraping to post on twitter.
As I alredy said before, this script is a showoff / proof of concept I made just for fun on my freetime and I never used it. It will not be supported throught time and I DO NOT encurage anyone to use this.
I will include no tutorial on how to use this bot.

## Features

- **Reddit Image Posting**: The bot fetches images (and their captions) from specified subreddits at regular intervals and posts them to a Twitter account.
- **ChatGPT Integration**: The bot can respond to comments on Twitter using the ChatGPT unofficial API, providing engaging interactions with users.
- **Random reaction Posting**: The bot can react with images to any comment.
- **Completely Undetectable**: Every action (posting, retweeting, commenting ecc...) is randomized between bounds you can select in the "confing.txt" file.
- **Non stop Worker**: Once you start it you don't have to look at it, it auto-detects errors and reacts to it; if anything unexpected happens it stops to not make any damage.
- **Keeps track of what he posts**: So you can be sure no double posts will appear in your feed.
